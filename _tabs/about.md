# 👋 Hello Hackers!

I'm **Sayed Reda** — but you might know me as **0xS4Y3D**.

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at the **Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University**.  
🕵️‍♂️ I'm also a **Penetration Tester** and an active **Bug Bounty Hunter**.

## 🔥 What Drives Me

I live and breathe **Offensive Security**.  
From diving into CTFs to digging through real-world targets, I'm all about breaking things (ethically) to make the digital world safer.

This blog is my corner of the internet where I’ll be:

- ✍️ Sharing **CTF writeups**
- 🧠 Documenting **techniques & tools**
- 🐞 Publishing **Bug Bounty findings**

If you're into exploitation, red teaming, or just curious about how hackers think — you're in the right place.
